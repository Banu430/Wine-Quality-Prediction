## README: Wine Quality Prediction Using Python and MATLAB  

### Overview  
This project focuses on predicting the quality of wine using machine learning techniques in Python and MATLAB. By analyzing chemical properties of wines, the model provides an accurate quality prediction, aiding wineries and consumers in making informed decisions.  

### Key Features  
- **Python Implementation**: Uses advanced machine learning algorithms like Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for classification and regression.  
- **MATLAB Integration**: Includes data visualization, preprocessing, and predictive modeling using MATLABâ€™s machine learning toolbox.  
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Supports exploratory data analysis (EDA) with visual insights into correlations between chemical properties and wine quality.  
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Combines the strengths of Pythonâ€™s libraries (e.g., Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) and MATLABâ€™s robust modeling tools.  

### Project Workflow  
1. **Data Collection**: Utilizes publicly available wine datasets, such as the Wine Quality Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.  
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, normalizes features, and performs feature selection to optimize model performance.  
3. **Model Development**:  
   - Python: Implements algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting.  
   - MATLAB: Constructs and evaluates models using MATLABâ€™s inbuilt machine learning functions.  
4. **Evaluation**: Assesses models based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  
5. **Deployment**: Offers a prototype for integrating the model into real-world applications.  

### Tools and Technologies  
- **Programming Languages**: Python 3.9+, MATLAB R2022b+  
- **Python Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **MATLAB Features**: Machine Learning Toolbox, Statistical Analysis, and Visualization
